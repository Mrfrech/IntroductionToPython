# In this section we are gonna learn about fumctions 
# fuctions are the block of code that we an use we its invoke or calls 

# By using functions we can reduce our work by reusing of this block of code several times
# Some examples

a = 3

def helloworld() : # Defining of function
    if a > 2 :
        print('helloWorld')

helloworld() # Invoking of function




data = "mrfrech"

def helloworld2() :
    if type(data) == str : # type() is pre-defined function that tells us type of data
        print('This is string datatype')

helloworld2()
